# 💼 Rohan's Portfolio
Welcome to my *work-in-progress* portfolio! This is an overview of my portfolio projects with links to the more in-depth documentation. If you are interested in talking, collaborating on a fun project, are looking for a data analyst, or just want to following along with my learning journey, please [get in touch](#connect-with-me) 😄!

## R
| Project Link | Area | Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|-------------|------------|
| 🎸 [Song Popularity Prediction](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/song-popularity) | Data Cleaning, EDA,  Predictive Modelling & Fine-Tuning, Dashboarding | Used R to clean, analyze, and visualize a dataset of 1200 songs with 19 characteristics. Tested several models to find which best predicted a song's popularity. Also used RShiny to create a song popularity prediction dashboard. | dplyr,  ggplot2, felm, gbm, randomForest, broom, Rshiny, leaps, glmnet |
| 🏠 [US Housing Analysis](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/us-housing-analysis) | Data Cleaning, EDA, Predicitve Modelling & Fine-Tuning, Reporting | (*In process of being reformatted*)  Conducted an analysis of the US housing market by combining and analyzing three datasets from Kaggle.com. Created several machine learning models to predict housing price index and to used clustering techniques to further explore the data. Created simple R shiny dashboard to visualize clustering.| dplyr, ggplot2, kable, MASS, broom, modelr, purr, rpart, randomForest, caret, factoextra, cluster, Rshiny |
| (*WIP*) 🚗 [CarMax Analytics](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/carmax-analytics-showcase) | Data Cleaning, EDA, Predictive Modelling, Dimensionality Reduction | (*In process of being reformatted*)  Using CarMax trade-in data from the **CarMax Analytics Case Competition**, conducted data cleaning & feature engineering before using visualizations and hypothesis testing to extract business insights about the CarMax trade-in process. Also created a random forest model to predict a traded-in car's value and used PCA to reduce the dimensionality of the data. | dplyr, ggplot2, randomForest, caret, factoMine, factoextra |

## Python
| Project Link | Area | Description | Libraries |
|--------------|------|-------------|-----------|
| (*WIP*) 🐍 [CS50P](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/cs-50-python) | Python Programming | This repo includes, notes, examples, and problem solutions to each lecture (*ongoing*) in the CS50 Python course. | - |
| (*WIP*) 🏈 [NFL Playoff Predictor](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/nfl-playoff-predictor) | Data Collection, Data Wrangling & EDA, Predictive Modelling | Using self-collected data on the characteristics of NFL teams that make the playoffs, create visualizations, analyses, and predictive models with the goal of predicting a team's chance of making the playoffs based on their regular season performance. | pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn |

*I am currently working on updating the repositories of my python projects. You can view them in the pinned section of my profile for now!*

## Data Visualization/Business Intelligence
| Project Link | Area | Description | Tools |
|--------------|------|-------------|-------|
| 📈 [US Economic Indicators](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/economic-indicators) | Data Collection, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Dashboarding | Collected US economic data from several online sources. Cleaned, organized and explored economic indicator data before using Tableau and Figma to develop a high-level analytic dashboard. | Python, Tableau |

## SQL
| Project Link | Area | Description |
|--------------|------|-------------|
| (*WIP) 🔍 [8-Week SQL Challenge](https://github.com/r0hankrishnan/8-week-sql) | Self-Learning, Data Cleaning, Data Querying, Data Analysis | This repository will contain analyses, notes, and solutions for the 8 case studies as I work through the 8-Week SQL Challenge from Data With Danny. |
